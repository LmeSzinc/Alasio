        Both phases poll (RESTART_WAIT_POLL) and restart_cancel() (abort) makes
        the wait return from either of them: it then reports the cancellation
        (False) and the caller must not continue with the restart -- the cancel
        path owns the state cleanup and no resume file may be written.

        On success the returned list is frozen by this call (see
        _freeze_restart_resume_list): the orchestration writes exactly it into
        the resume file, so a stop request on one of its configs after the wait
        is refused with an explicit error instead of cancelling something the
        file keeps (F4).
