"""
Password strength rule of the web ui password (``config/deploy.yaml``
-> ``Backend.Password``).

The rule is enforced at runtime, deliberately not as a msgspec field
constraint: YamlConfig falls back to the field default when a value
fails validation, so a constraint would silently replace the password
the user set and the user could no longer tell what is configured.
Instead the configured password is kept as is, a weak one is reported
with a warning at startup and treated as unset by the admission gate
(DeploymentGateMiddleware rule A): remote access is refused, only the
local electron client still passes.

The message of the rule lives here too: the startup warning uses it,
and it is the reference text the frontend translation mirrors. The two
are maintained independently and kept in sync by hand (the manual
contract noted on both sides): reword this message first, then follow
up in frontend/src/i18n/Auth.json (t.Auth.ErrDeployPasswordTooWeak).
"""

# Message of a password that fails the rule: logged at startup, and the
# reference text of the frontend translation t.Auth.ErrDeployPasswordTooWeak
# (frontend/src/i18n/Auth.json). It is the single description of the rule
# in the backend, keep it in sync with the check below whenever the rule
# changes, and with the frontend translation (manual contract).

    Check whether a password fails the strength rule.

    The rule and WEAK_PASSWORD_MESSAGE are the single policy point of
    the password strength: stronger requirements such as "at least one
    digit and one letter" are added here, and the message above is
    reworded in the same edit (the frontend translation mirrors it).
