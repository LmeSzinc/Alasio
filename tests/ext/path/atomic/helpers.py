Helpers shared by the tests of alasio.ext.path.atomic.

The atomic functions retry on PermissionError with an exponential
backoff on Windows (windows_attempt_delay). The helpers break the os
functions without a real file lock, and replace the sleep of the
module, so the retry tests observe every attempt without waiting.
